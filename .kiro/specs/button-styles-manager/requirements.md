# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The ButtonStylesManager feature aims to eliminate code duplication and unify button styling across the restaurant-roulette application. Currently, button styles like `h-[72px] p-3 rounded-lg border-2` and theme gradients are repeated across multiple components, creating maintenance overhead and inconsistency. This feature will create a centralized button styling system that maintains compatibility with the existing theme system while reducing code duplication by 80% and improving development efficiency.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a centralized button styling system, so that I can maintain consistent button appearance across all components without code duplication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer needs to create a button THEN the system SHALL provide a ButtonStylesManager with predefined style constants
2. WHEN a developer uses ButtonStylesManager THEN the system SHALL eliminate duplicate style definitions like `h-[72px] p-3 rounded-lg border-2`
3. WHEN ButtonStylesManager is implemented THEN the system SHALL reduce button-related duplicate code by at least 80%
4. WHEN using ButtonStylesManager THEN the system SHALL maintain 100% compatibility with existing CSS variables like `--theme-primary` and `--theme-accent`

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want standardized button variants and states, so that all buttons have consistent behavior and appearance across different themes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ButtonStylesManager is created THEN the system SHALL provide primary, secondary, and success button variants
2. WHEN a button variant is applied THEN the system SHALL use appropriate CSS variables for theme compatibility
3. WHEN button states are needed THEN the system SHALL provide normal, disabled, and loading states
4. WHEN theme switching occurs THEN all buttons SHALL automatically adapt to the new theme colors
5. WHEN a button is in disabled state THEN the system SHALL apply opacity 0.3 and cursor 'not-allowed'

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want utility functions for button styling, so that I can easily generate button classes and styles programmatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ButtonStylesManager is implemented THEN the system SHALL provide a getButtonClasses function
2. WHEN getButtonClasses is called THEN the system SHALL return appropriate Tailwind classes for the specified variant and size
3. WHEN ButtonStylesManager is implemented THEN the system SHALL provide a getButtonStyle function
4. WHEN getButtonStyle is called THEN the system SHALL return inline styles including theme colors and state properties
5. WHEN utility functions are used THEN the system SHALL automatically include margin: 0 and touchAction: 'manipulation' fixes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want backward compatibility with existing button implementations, so that I can migrate components gradually without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ButtonStylesManager is introduced THEN existing button components SHALL continue to function without modification
2. WHEN migrating existing components THEN the system SHALL maintain the same visual appearance and behavior
3. WHEN ButtonStylesManager is used THEN the system SHALL support all existing theme configurations (舞鶴, 柒宿, etc.)
4. WHEN components are migrated THEN touch interactions and responsive design SHALL remain unchanged
5. WHEN ButtonStylesManager is implemented THEN existing API methods like getAddButtonStyle SHALL continue to work

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive button size and styling options, so that I can create buttons appropriate for different UI contexts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ButtonStylesManager is created THEN the system SHALL provide standard (h-[72px]) and compact (h-12) button sizes
2. WHEN a button size is specified THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate padding, border radius, and shadow styles
3. WHEN buttons are created THEN the system SHALL ensure consistent flex layout with centered content
4. WHEN ButtonStylesManager is used THEN the system SHALL provide smooth transitions with duration-200
5. WHEN buttons are rendered THEN the system SHALL include shadow-lg for standard and shadow-md for compact sizes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the ButtonStylesManager to integrate seamlessly with the existing project architecture, so that it works within the pure static architecture constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ButtonStylesManager is implemented THEN the system SHALL work with CDN-loaded React without requiring a build process
2. WHEN ButtonStylesManager is used THEN the system SHALL be compatible with the existing Tailwind CSS setup
3. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL maintain compatibility with the current static hosting architecture
4. WHEN ButtonStylesManager is created THEN it SHALL be implemented as a plain JavaScript object without external dependencies
5. WHEN components use ButtonStylesManager THEN the system SHALL maintain performance characteristics of the existing implementation
